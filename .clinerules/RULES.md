# Project Rules & Conventions

> This file is the single source of truth for project conventions.
> Update it every time a new rule or pattern is established.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- **`apps/`** — Deployable applications (follows Turborepo convention)
  - `apps/web/` — Next.js App Router frontend (`@auto-rfp/web`)
  - `apps/functions/` — AWS Lambda handlers (`@auto-rfp/functions`)
- **`packages/`** — Shared libraries & tooling
  - `packages/core/` — Shared Zod schemas & TypeScript types (`@auto-rfp/core`)
  - `packages/infra/` — AWS CDK infrastructure stacks (`@auto-rfp/infra`)
- **`scripts/`** — Utility scripts for maintenance and migrations

---

## 🧩 Entity Definitions

- **Every entity MUST be defined in `packages/core/` using Zod schemas.**
- TypeScript types are always inferred from Zod schemas using `z.infer<>` — never define types manually.
- Each entity gets its own file in `packages/core/src/schemas/`.
- Schemas must be re-exported from `packages/core/src/index.ts`.
- Use `CreateXxxSchema` (omit id + timestamps) and `UpdateXxxSchema` (partial) patterns for CRUD.
- **DynamoDB Item Types**: If an entity schema does not include `partition_key` and `sort_key` properties, define a separate `EntityNameDBItem` type in `apps/functions/src/types/` that extends the base entity type with DynamoDB keys:
  ```typescript
  import { PK_NAME, SK_NAME } from '@/constants/common';
  import { EntityItem } from '@auto-rfp/core';
  
  export type EntityDBItem = EntityItem & {
    [PK_NAME]: string;
    [SK_NAME]: string;
  };
  ```
  This allows type-safe access to DynamoDB keys without polluting the core schema with infrastructure concerns.

---

## ⚡ Lambda Handlers

- **Lambdas MUST be slim/thin.** They are responsible only for:
  1. Parsing the incoming event (extracting path params, query params, body)
  2. Calling the appropriate service/helper function
  3. Returning the formatted HTTP response
- **NO business logic in Lambda handlers.** All business logic lives in `apps/functions/helpers/` and domain-specific service files.
- Validation results should be destructured: `const { success, data, errors } = validateInput(...)`.
- Each handler is organized by domain under `apps/functions/<domain>/`.
- **Every Lambda MUST have an explicit CloudWatch Log Group** defined in CDK with controlled retention (2 weeks for non-prod, retained for prod).

---

## 🧠 Business Logic & Services

- All business logic lives in **`apps/functions/helpers/`** and domain-specific files.
- Services are organized by domain within the functions directory structure.
- Services receive validated, typed data — they never parse raw events.
- Services interact with DynamoDB, Cognito, and other AWS services.

---

## 🗄️ DynamoDB Design (Single-Table)

- We use a **single-table design** with a shared DynamoDB table.
- **PK (Partition Key)**: Use constants from `PK` object — **no magic strings**.
  - `PK.USER`, `PK.ORGANIZATION`, `PK.PROJECT`, etc. (defined in `apps/functions/constants/`)
- **SK (Sort Key)**: Composite key with `#` separator, built via helper functions.
  - Pattern: `{orgId}#{projectId}#{entityId}` (empty segments are omitted)
  - Use helper functions — never construct SK strings manually.
- **Multitenancy**: All entities support optional `orgId` as the first SK segment.
  - `orgId` scopes data to an organization. When empty, data is global.
  - Example: `PK = PK.USER`, `SK = "org123#proj456#user789"`
  - Query by org: `skPrefix = "org123"`, by org+project: `skPrefix = "org123#proj456"`
- Each entity has key builder functions in their respective function handlers.
- GSI1 can be used for access patterns that reverse PK/SK.
- All DynamoDB operations go through helper functions in `apps/functions/helpers/`.
- All services accept `orgId` as a parameter (can be undefined for global scope).

---

## 👤 User Management

- **Users MUST be created in both DynamoDB AND Cognito.**
- When creating a user:
  1. Create the user in Cognito (via `@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-provider`)
  2. Store the user record in DynamoDB with the Cognito `sub` as the user ID
- User deletion should clean up both Cognito and DynamoDB.

---

## 🌐 Frontend Deployment

- **Frontend is deployed via AWS Amplify Hosting** (not S3 + CloudFront).
- The CDK stack uses `@aws-cdk/aws-amplify-alpha` to define the Amplify app.
- The built `apps/web/dist` is deployed as an S3 asset to an Amplify branch.

---

## 🏗️ Infrastructure (CDK)

- All infrastructure is defined in `packages/infra/lib/`.
- Stacks are organized by concern:
  - `api/` — API Gateway + Lambda function definitions
  - `database-stack.ts` — DynamoDB table + GSIs
  - `auth-stack.ts` — Cognito User Pool + Client
  - `amplify-fe-stack.ts` — Amplify Hosting for frontend
  - `storage-stack.ts` — S3 buckets for file storage
  - `network-stack.ts` — VPC and networking resources
- Stack outputs are used to pass values between stacks (e.g., table name, user pool ID).
- Environment variables are passed to Lambda functions for resource references.
- Multi-stage support via environment-specific configurations.

## 🌐 Frontend Architecture (`apps/web`) — Next.js App Router + DDD

### Framework & Structure

- **Framework**: Next.js 15+ with App Router
- **Path aliases**: Use `@/*` for all imports (e.g., `import { UserList } from '@/components/users/UserList'`)
- **Route groups**: `(auth)` and `(dashboard)` use different layouts without affecting URL paths
- **Auth guard**: Dashboard layout redirects to `/login` if not authenticated

### Component Architecture

- **Server vs Client Components**:
  - Root `layout.tsx` is a Server Component (defines metadata, wraps with Providers)
  - All interactive components use `'use client'` directive
  - `Providers.tsx` wraps the app with SWR config and Amplify initialization
- **Feature modules** (Feature-Sliced Design): Each domain has its own directory with clear subdirectories:
  ```
  features/
  ├── users/
  │   ├── components/       # Presentation-only components
  │   │   └── UserList.tsx
  │   ├── hooks/            # Feature-specific logic hooks
  │   │   ├── useCreateUser.ts
  │   │   └── useEditUser.ts
  │   └── index.ts          # Barrel export
  ```
  - **Components must be pure presentation** — no business logic, API calls, or routing
  - **Logic lives in feature hooks** in the `hooks/` subdirectory
  - **Barrel exports** (`index.ts`) — pages import from `@/features/users`, never from internal paths

### Pages & Routing

- **Create/Edit pages MUST be separate pages** — never inline forms in list pages or use dialogs/modals
  - Create: `/users/create` → `app/(dashboard)/users/create/page.tsx`
  - Edit: `/users/[id]/edit` → `app/(dashboard)/users/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
  - List pages link to create/edit pages via `<Link>` with breadcrumb navigation

### Data Fetching & State

- **Data fetching**: Use **SWR** with `authenticatedFetcher` for all client-side API calls
  - `useApi<T>(path)` — Generic hook for GET requests with caching
  - `apiMutate(path, options)` — Helper for POST/PUT/DELETE
- **Authentication**: Use **AWS Amplify** (`aws-amplify`) to authenticate with Cognito
  - `useAuth()` hook provides `signIn`, `signOut`, `isAuthenticated`, `username`
  - JWT tokens are automatically attached to API requests via `authenticatedFetcher`
- **Health check**: `useHealth()` hook polls `/health` every 30s
  - `HealthBanner` component shows an error banner when the API is unreachable
- **API Response Types**: All response types (`UsersResponse`, `UserResponse`, etc.) are defined in `@auto-rfp/core` — never define inline interfaces in components

### Forms

- Use **react-hook-form** with `@hookform/resolvers/zod` and Zod schemas from `@auto-rfp/core`
- Use `z.input<typeof Schema>` as the form type (handles `.default()` fields correctly)
- Use `zodResolver(Schema)` for validation
- No manual `useState` for form fields — use `register()` from react-hook-form

### UI & Styling

- **Styling**: Use **Tailwind CSS v4** — no raw CSS files. All styling via utility classes
  - Custom theme tokens defined in `globals.css` via `@theme` directive
  - Indigo (`indigo-500`) as primary color, Slate for neutrals, Emerald for success
- **UI Components**: Use **Shadcn UI** components from `@/components/ui/`
  - Components: `Button`, `Input`, `Select`, `Card`, `Badge`, `PageHeader`, `Breadcrumb`, etc.
  - **Never use raw HTML elements** for buttons, inputs, cards, etc. — always use the UI components
  - To swap the underlying component library, only change the `components/ui/` implementations

### Loading States

- **ALWAYS use skeleton components for loading states** — never use spinners or "Loading..." text
- **Page-level loading**: Use `PageLoadingSkeleton` from `@/components/layout/page-loading-skeleton`
  - Create `loading.tsx` files in route directories that render appropriate skeleton components
  - Skeleton variants: `list`, `grid`, `detail` — choose based on the content being loaded
  - Example: `<PageLoadingSkeleton variant="detail" hasDescription />` for detail pages
- **Component-level loading**: Use `Skeleton` from `@/components/ui/skeleton` for inline loading states

### Environment Variables

- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side env vars

---

## 🚀 CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

- **Branching strategy**:
  - `develop` — Development branch (deploys to **dev** environment)
  - `main` — Test branch (deploys to **test** environment)
  - Feature branches → PR to `develop`
  - `develop` → PR to `main` for promotion to test
- **Workflows** (`.github/workflows/`):
  - `ci.yml` — Runs on every push/PR to `develop` and `main`: install → build → test → upload artifacts
  - `deploy-dev.yml` — Triggered on push to `develop`: builds and deploys all CDK stacks with `-c stage=dev`
  - `deploy-test.yml` — Triggered on push to `main`: builds and deploys all CDK stacks with `-c stage=test`
- **AWS authentication**: Uses OIDC (`id-token: write`) with `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4`.
  - Requires `AWS_ROLE_ARN` secret and optional `AWS_REGION` variable per GitHub environment.
- **GitHub Environments**: `dev` and `test` environments should be configured in repo settings with appropriate secrets.
- **Concurrency**: CI jobs cancel in-progress runs; deploy jobs do NOT cancel (to avoid partial deployments).
- **Caching**: pnpm store is cached between runs for faster installs.

---

## 🔧 General Conventions

- Use ESM (`"type": "module"`) everywhere.
- Target Node.js 20+ for Lambda runtime.
- Use `pnpm` as the package manager with workspaces.
- Prefer `const` over `let`; never use `var`.
- Use TypeScript strict mode in all packages.
- Destructure where possible for cleaner code.
- **Never use `.js` extensions in import paths.** Use `moduleResolution: "bundler"` in tsconfig.

## 🔒 Audit Trail

**Every new handler, service, or AI feature MUST write audit log entries for all significant actions.**
Never ship a new feature without audit coverage. Audit logs are required for security compliance (FedRAMP, ISO 27001), debugging, and data access tracking.

### When to Write Audit Logs

Write an audit log entry for **every** action that:
- Creates, updates, or deletes a resource (CRUD)
- Triggers an AI generation (document, brief, answer)
- Invokes an AI tool (DynamoDB query, semantic search, etc.)
- Changes permissions or configuration
- Accesses sensitive data (org details, user info, contact data)
- Starts or completes a pipeline or background job
- Results in a failure or error that affects a user

### How to Write Audit Logs

Use `writeAuditLog()` from `apps/functions/src/helpers/audit-log.ts`:

```typescript
import { writeAuditLog } from '@/helpers/audit-log';
import { getHmacSecret } from '@/helpers/secret';
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
import { nowIso } from '@/helpers/date';

await writeAuditLog(
  {
    logId: uuidv4(),
    timestamp: nowIso(),
    userId: event.auth?.userId ?? 'system',
    userName: event.auth?.userName ?? 'system',
    organizationId: orgId,
    action: 'DOCUMENT_CREATED',
    resource: 'document',
    resourceId: documentId,
    changes: { after: { documentType, title } },
    ipAddress: event.requestContext?.http?.sourceIp ?? '0.0.0.0',
    userAgent: event.headers?.['user-agent'] ?? 'system',
    result: 'success',
  },
  await getHmacSecret(),
);
```

- **Background workers** (SQS, Step Functions): use `userId: 'system'`, `ipAddress: '0.0.0.0'`, `userAgent: 'system'`
- **High-frequency events** (e.g., AI tool calls): use non-blocking `.catch()` pattern — never `await` for non-critical audit writes
- **New audit actions**: add to `AuditActionSchema` in `packages/core/src/schemas/audit.ts` before using
- **Do NOT log PII or secrets** in `changes` — omit passwords, tokens, truncate large text fields (max 500 chars)
- **Always log failures** — emit `*_FAILED` action on errors, not just success

See [10-audit-trail.md](10-audit-trail.md) for full details and examples.

## 🎯 TypeScript Best Practices

- **NEVER use `any` type.** Always use proper types, `unknown`, or type assertions when absolutely necessary.
  - If you need to cast, use specific type assertions (e.g., `as DocumentDBItem`) instead of `as any`.
  - Use `unknown` for truly unknown types and narrow them with type guards.
- **NEVER define types manually without Zod schemas.**
  - All types MUST be inferred from Zod schemas using `z.infer<typeof Schema>`.
  - Exception: Infrastructure-specific types like `DocumentDBItem` that extend core types with DynamoDB keys.
  - This ensures runtime validation matches compile-time types.
- **Use type guards** for runtime type checking instead of type assertions when possible.
- **Prefer interfaces over types** for object shapes (except when inferring from Zod).
- **Use discriminated unions** for complex type scenarios instead of `any` or loose types.
